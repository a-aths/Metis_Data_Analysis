[michael laughs] i'll just go later. so you have the directions. you have a toothbrush. you have a cell phone charger. come on, man. she goes to new york in like 10 minutes. what happened? call me when you get in. [kisses pam] bye. why haven't i proposed yet? uh, actually pam and i talked about it. and we just decided that, um -- well, we didn't want to spend first three months of our engagement apart. and pam's always said she doesn't want a long engagement. something in her past, i guess. i'm not really sure of the whole story, but something about a guy who used to work here... i can't believe i'm saying this, but michael is actually k*ll it with holly. and i think i know why. it's because holly is kind of a major dork. i don't really know ronnie. but i have a feeling i will get to know her very well over the next few years, and eventually declare my love for her. when michael told us that jan was pregnant, he led us to believe that he was the father. by telling us that he was the father. all right, i am connecting and ... you are not there. did you install it right? how about this all right! so what is going on, girl in the computer? uh-huh. that's not what that is. i would like to lose 65 pounds. cryogenics. beer me five. all right, i'm taking off. nope, just going to see pam. maybe put up some shelves. ok, thank you for ... this. no. [knocks on door] hi. oh, that's so rude of me. have you seen, um, pam's new art? it's right there. check it out. [closes door] [watching baseball game on tv] some girl came into pam's room crying about her roommate stealing her soy milk. so i'm in here waiting it out. well that's great. [shakes ryan's hand] you're talking about your court ordered community service? but he did, right? all right. nope. mmm. how much weight have you lost, dwight? no, you're definitely the problem. probably the weirdest thing about pam being gone would be lunch... actually. but um, it will force me to become acquaintances with people i consider... coworkers. fair question. see, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you. summers going great. just spent two hours listening to michael clump. i have a weird pain in my left side that i'm convinced is an ulcer. my girlfriend lives in new york and i haven't seen her in 10 days. how's your summer? so as it turns out, tonight is my nephews t-ball game and i kinda missed the first three, so... i know. i suck. dwight says ""hi."" now he is saying ""hi"" louder. umm... hey, can you go to im? ok. i'm gonna write you up for not working.
