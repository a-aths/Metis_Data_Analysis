# Metis Data Analysis 
Coursework and Projects from Metis Data Analysis Flex Bootcamp January-May 2022

## Module One: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Late Night At MOMA PS1: Leveraging Commuter Data to Boost Attendance Metrics
* Analyzed NYC MTA turnstile dataset of 100,000+ observations
* Aggregated data to weekday-by-season ridership of stations within two stops of MOMA PS1
* Visualized turnstile usage to determine peak ridership day & time and inform optimal visitor hours for a weekly Late Night event.

## Module Two: Linear Regression (LR)
### Box Office Hits: Predicting Gross Earnings
* Built a linear regression model that predicts gross box office earnings based on baseline film characteristics
* Scraped film characteristics of 1500 films using Beautiful Soup
* Performed feature engineering, regularization; tuned model using k-fold cross validation

## Module Three: Business Fundamentals (BF)
### Funding Equity in Philadelphia 
* Created three Tableau dashboards visualizing access to nonprofit services in Philadelphia by neighborhood; assessed access to educational and health facilities.
* Compiled 17,000 observations of Demographic and Nonprofit Financial data.
* Built visualizations that identified high-need, low-access neighborhoods for various health and education services.

## Module Four: Machine Learning & Classification (ML)
### Detecting Diabetes In Indigenous Communities
* Built a decision tree classification model that uses baseline health measures to predict if someone has diabetes. 
* Tuned and cross-validated the model using Grid Search CV and K-fold validation. Boosted predictive performance to 89.2%
* Trained the model on the Pima Indians Dataset containing 74 observations.

## Module Five: Natural Language Processing (NLP)
### The Office Character Arc Model
* Constructed an NLP topic modeling pipeline to identify predominant themes for main character of The Office, and mapped their prevalance over six seasons.
* Scraped a corpus of 66 episode scripts using Beautiful Soup.
* Fit unsupervised and semi-supervised topic-modeling algorithms such as PCA, SVD, LDA, NMF & CoreEx
